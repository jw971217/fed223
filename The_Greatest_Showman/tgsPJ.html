                                <p>Zac Efron as Phillip Carlyle, a playwright who becomes Barnum's partner. Theater actor. He is a handsome young man from the upper class, and has been successful in theatrical box office several times and has both wealth and fame. Barnum, who was ignored by the high society for being vulgar, offers a partnership to create a show that will work for them as well. At first, he refuses the offer, saying, "Why should I work with you when I have everything?" but eventually he is persuaded by Barnum to "let me come out of the boring cage and have freedom."[26] In the meantime, they fall in love with each other at a glance by Anne Willer, a public figure, but they are conflicted because of the surrounding gaze of Anne, who is black, and because of her face, they go to the theater to save her and then accept each other. At the end, Barnum, who is retiring, takes over his hat, stands on stage as a showman, and kisses Anne as the end of the circus, finally bearing the fruit of his love.
                                    Barnum, who was left penniless by the fire, was able to make a comeback for the film only. He asked Barnum, who came to recruit him, to give him 10% of his profits, but unlike Barnum, who went all-in on a new business (Jenny Lind's performance) and blew it home with a large loan, he was steadily saving his share, and using it to rebuild the circus.</p>

                                <p>Rebecca Ferguson as Jenny Lind, a famous Swedish singer known as the "Swedish Nightingale"
                                    I am the most popular opera singer in Europe. It is a big star nicknamed "Sweden's Nightingale" due to its singing voice that takes out the soul of people and the good deed of donating most of the money earned from songs to orphans and widows. I meet Barnum for the first time in England, and I accept his offer to perform in the U.S. when Barnum said he would make him receive the highest praise on the world's best stage.At first, he was unhappy to think of Barnum as a snob who had never heard of his song, but when asked, "Why are you offering me that?" Barnum said, "The audience comes to my show because they want to be fooled. But I want to show them the real thing at least once," and I'm persuaded by him. When his first performance in the United States was a huge success, he formed a partnership with Barnum and performed on a national tour. He tries to seduce Barnum as he is attached to Barnum throughout the tour, but when Barnum refuses to do so, he is hurt and stops the tour. After being rejected by Barnum, he finishes his last stage and kisses Barnum abruptly in front of the audience and reporters, saying goodbye. As it made headlines, Barnum suffers from a scandal, and Barnum's wife leaves home in betrayal and returns to her parents' home. For your information, he is also the biggest victim of the movie, and for more information, see the section "Difference from True Story" below.</p>

                                <p>Michelle Williams as Charity Hallett-Barnum, the wife of P. T. Barnum
                                    A woman who was born as a daughter of the upper class, but had faith so unconstrained that she married her childhood friend, poor Barnum. His father, an incredibly conservative high-class figure, noticed their relationship and sent Cherryty to a distant boarding school, but he was so great that he continued to exchange love letters with Barnum and eventually got married. Even after marriage, when their daughters are ignored by their upper class children, Cherryty said, 'The upper class will look at us with their colored glasses on until the end. You don't have to be loved by everyone. I just need a few good things,' he said, pointing out the wrong side of the upper class. Of course, I think that my husband's false dream is somewhat reckless with intellectual Barnum, but I don't oppose his business idea, and I think he was attracted to such a popping and passionate aspect. However, disappointed that her husband had not said a word to her that he was in trouble after being caught in an affair with Jenny Lind and that her house was seized by a bank due to excessive business expansion, which led Barnum to reflect on himself by singing "FROM NOW ON." He was disappointed when he failed to keep his promise in the lyrics of the song "AMILLION DREAMS" that he would be with him even when he was tired and happy. Afterwards, I will resolve all misunderstandings with Barnum and return to a happy life even though I am not as rich as I used to be.</p>

                                <!-- 캐릭터 설명 -->
                                <p>Anne Wheeler as Zendaya, an acrobat, a trapeze artist, W.D.’s younger sister and Phillip’s love interest. Aerial acrobat. With his brother W.D. Wheeler, he applies to Barnum's circus and performs aerial acrobatics. Although she was not in the movie, unlike her brother, Anne is an appearance that can never come out without a mix of white blood, and the actual actor is also a mixture of a white mother and a black father. On the other hand, the older brother's family environment would not have been smooth unless he was cast without thinking, although his parents were both black (and so are real actors). Philip and Carlyle feel strange at first sight, then watch Jenny Lind's performance with Philip, and then touch each other's fingers and confirm each other's feelings [28] shortly after Philip confirms that his parents are here, he lets go of his hand. He is disappointed by Philip's behavior in front of his parents, who is not confident in his love with him, and in the scene where he sings "This is Me," he glares at Philip to the horror. Philip then repents his actions and invites her to the theater as Barnum invites her to tell her how he feels, when his father happens to meet his parents in front of Anne and says to her, "Are you ashamed to go around with a black man?" He runs out and eats again. Unlike Jenny Lind's performance, however, Philip comes after Anne, complaining that she is ashamed to say such rude things to her father, and eventually continues to entice her to practice aerobatics. Like this, Philip keeps courting and Anne refuses that we can't be achieved, and the song that they sing together in the air is 'Rewrite the stars', which is one of the best scenes in the movie.</p>

                                <p>Keala Settle as Lettie Lutz, a bearded lady. As one of Barnum's circus members, Barnum visits the museum himself and casts them in the process of recruiting journalists. Rumors of an unusual person admire Barnum when he hears a beautiful song from somewhere, a woman with a thick beard and a fat figure. It is a great shock to the circus members, and its weight is large. He has excellent singing skills, and usually plays a singing role in the circus. Keala Settle is also a real singer.</p>
